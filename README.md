Text classification using deep learning model

The python scripts uploaded had been tested and run using Spyder(Python 3.8).
The source of the data used for this analysis is:

### FOLDERS AND FILES
**figures folder**: classification report, tensorboard interface for performance evaluation, model architecture
**__pycache__**: Auto generated file to connect the modules with the training file.
**log_sentiment_analysis**: history of training for tensorboard visualization.
**__init__.py**: initial file to connect classes and functions with training file.
**ohe.pkl**: pickle file stored one hot encoder trained
**sentiment_analysis_h5**: saved trained model
**textdoc_modules.py**: all the classes and functions created to ease the training process
**textdoc_train.py**: python script for model training
**tokenizer_sentiment.json**: json file stored tokenizer trained
